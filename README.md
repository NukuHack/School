## License

This project is licensed under "no" license.
- Meaning you may take whatever you need, you can distribute it (or even make money from it, but I bet ou won't).

## Acknowledgments

- Basically nothing, just the scool pc-s get reset often so I had to use an alternative (online) storage to store what I really want.
- Built using AI, because I'm lazy.
